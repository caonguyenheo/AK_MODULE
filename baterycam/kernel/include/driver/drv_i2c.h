 * It should be call after i2c_init if want to reset the I2C transmit freq.It should not be call in transmiting data.
 * The default delay time value is 90, because we use cpu loop to delay, the cycle and freq will be relate to the cpu freq too.
 * We have test that, in default delay time and the cpu run between 15M and 84M, the I2C transmit ok.  
 * if the data transmit ok, we suggest not reset the delay time.
 * But if data transmit error, and the I2C freq is too high or too low. can use this function to reset the freq of I2C.
